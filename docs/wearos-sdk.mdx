# TerraWearOS Library

This library should be used in conjunction with [TerraRTAndroid](https://github.com/tryterra/TerraRTAndroid)
.  
It uses Bluetooth Connection to stream data to your android device and then from there streams to Terra through websockets!

**It is meant to be used for WearOS Apps!**

## Installation

The library is on mavenCentral!

You may add it as a dependency on your app gradle file as: `implementation co.tryterra:terra-wearos:0.0.2`

<Info>

## ðŸ“˜Please include the following in your AndroidManifest

```xml xml
> <queries>
>         <package android:name="com.google.android.wearable.healthservices" />
> </queries>

```



</Info>

## Usage

You will need to instantiate the `Terra` class as follows:

```kotlin kotlin
terra = Terra(context: Context, streamDataSet: Set<StreamDataTypes>

```

Upon initiating this class, you will be prompted with permissions for `Body Sensor`, `Location`, and `Activity Recognition`!

**Arguments**

*   `context: Context` => The app context you are calling this class from
*   `streamDataSet: Set<StreamDataTypes>` => The set of datatypes you wish to stream data for. Takes a set of `StreamDataTypes` enum.

### Initialise Bluetooth Connection

To put your device in discovery mode, run

```kotlin kotlin
terra.startBluetoothDiscovery(callback: (Boolean) -> Unit)

```

You may now search for this device with the TerraRTAndroid package to initialise the connection!

The callback will be called when the connection is completed with either `true` (successful) or `false` (unsuccessful).

### Stream Data

You may now streaming data to your device!

```kotlin kotlin
terra.startStream()

```

You can also stop streaming by

```kotlin kotlin
terra.stopStream()

```

### Exercises

You may also perform exercises on the device, and have the data streamed to your phone.

You will first have to prepare the exercise by:

```kotlin kotlin
terra.prepareExercise(type: ExerciseTypes, dataTypes: Set<DataTypes>, shouldEnableGPS: Boolean, callback: (Boolean) -> Unit)

```

**This is only for warming up sensors!!**

**Arguments**

*   `type: ExerciseTypes` => The type of exercise you wish to prepare for. Takes an `ExerciseTypes` enum.
*   `dataTypes: Set<DataTypes>` => The datatypes from this exercise you wish to retrieve. Takes a set of `DataTypes` enum
*   (Optional) `shouldEnableGPS: Boolean` => Default to false. Will determine if the location sensor needs to be warmed up or not ;)
*   (Optional) `callback` => A callback function indicating when and if the preparation of the exercise is completed and successful **(RECOMMENDED)**

After preparation, you may then start an exercise:

```kotlin kotlin
terra!!.startExercise(
  type: ExerciseTypes,
  dataTypes: Set<DataTypes>,
  shouldEnableGPS: Boolean,
  shouldEnableAutoPauseAndResume: Boolean,
)

```

**Arguments**

*   `type: ExerciseTypes` => The type of exercise you wish to prepare for. Takes an `ExerciseTypes` enum.
*   `dataTypes: Set<DataTypes>` => The datatypes from this exercise you wish to retrieve. Takes a set of `DataTypes` enum
*   (Optional) `shouldEnableGPS: Boolean` => Default to false. Allow for location data streaming
*   (Optional) `shouldEnableAutoPauseAndResume: Boolean` => Defaults to false. Allow for the watch to automatic pause and resume exercise.

Doing so will automatically start streaming data to your device!

There is also the capability to pause, resume, and stop the exercise:

```kotlin kotlin
terra.stopExercise()
terra.resumeExercise()
terra.pauseExercise()

```

The data will arrive in your websocket server in the following format:

```json json
{
  "op":5,
  "d":
    {
      "ts": <String> (In ISOFormat Date Form)
       "val": <Double>
       "d" <Array<Double>>
    },
    "uid": <String> (user ID)
    "seq": <Int>,
    "t": <String> (Datatype name: Exactly the same as the name of `DataTypes` enum)
}

```

`ts` is the timestamp of the record.

For Exercises, `t` will be a concatenation of the `ExerciseTypes` ENUM and `DataTypes` ENUM.  
For example, if you are performing a `RUNNING` exercise, while streaming `HEART_RATE` and `STEPS`, two different payloads will be streamed to your websocket connection with types: `RUNNING_HEART_RATE` and `RUNNING_STEPS`
